  User Story4: As a user, I want to select different number of raws to see users records


  Scenario Outline: Show records for "<count>" options
    Given I am on the login page
    And I login as a librarian
    And I click on "Users" link
    When I select Show <count> records
    Then show records value should be <count>
    And the users table must display <count> records
    Examples:
      | count |
      | 5     |
      | 10    |
      | 15    |
      | 50    |
      | 100   |
